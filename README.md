Thank you for registering for the upcoming Nextflow / Nf-core Hackathon from 27 – 29 March. 

**Final logistics**
* We are at the Chestnut Suite in Hinxton Hall. The way is through the dining room, but if you have trouble ask the conference centre reception.
* Start time is 9:30 and end time is 16:30 daily. But the room will open from 8am everyday until 5pm on Monday and 7pm on Tuesday and Wednesday.
* Please bring your laptops charged. There are plug points on each table, but they will have to be shared. And don't forget your chargers.
 
**Free food**
* There will be lunch for all attendees on Wednesday (Aromi). All dietary requirements provided have been included.
* There will also be refreshments during the day for everyone.
* For Sanger staff, there is catered lunch on Monday (Nanna Mexico) and Tuesday (Damas Bridge) as well. Others, please bring your lunch and join outside of Murray’s.
 
You can find tickets to *work* at the [nf-core board](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/projects/38), on the [campus issues board](https://github.com/priyanka-surana/wgc-nextflow-hackathon-mar23/issues) or bring your own projects. Please don't be intimidated! There are tonnes of different ways you can contribute, and we will be on hand to help.
